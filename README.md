# RSA-Encryption-Decryption-Project

Developed alongside two teammates Quinn Carson and Mitch Guthrie for an algorithms class project. An RSA standard encryption/decryption for a supplied number or string in python3. Implemented fast modular exponentiation, determined relative primality of randomly generated numbers, and calculated multiplicative inverse of numbers. Also implemented in a menu style UI.

Note: The limitation on this project is the size of the prime number chosen. If the prime number is large then the program slows down dramatically. This could be remedied with a different method of prime number calculation.
